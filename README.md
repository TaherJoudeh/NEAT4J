# NEAT4J
## Project Overview
NEAT4J is a Java implementation of the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm, designed to evolve artificial neural networks through genetic algorithms. This project provides a modular, configurable framework for experimenting with NEAT, including visualization, file I/O, and pre-built configurations.
